# monzo-py

A Python library for interacting with and analyzing your Monzo bank transactions using Google Sheets and DuckDB.

Transform your exported Monzo transaction data into a powerful analytical database with SQL querying capabilities and rich visualizations. Perfect for personal finance analysis, budgeting insights, and spending pattern discovery.

> [!NOTE]
> In order to use this library you must have a **paid Monzo account** with your transactions exported to a Google Sheet. Free Monzo accounts do not have access to transaction exports.

## Setup

### Google Sheets Setup

1. **Export your Monzo transactions** to a Google Sheet through your Monzo app and verify you can access the spreadsheet.

2. **Enable Google Sheets API access** by following the [Google Sheets Python Quickstart guide](https://developers.google.com/workspace/sheets/api/quickstart/python).

> [!CAUTION]
> **Security Warning**: Never commit or share your `credentials.json` file with your project. Add it to your `.gitignore` file immediately.

3. **Configure API permissions**:
   - In [Google Cloud Console Data Access](https://console.cloud.google.com/auth/scopes), add the `/auth/spreadsheets.readonly` scope
   - In [Audience settings](https://console.cloud.google.com/auth/audience), add yourself as a test user to access the API without publishing

4. **Get your spreadsheet ID** from your Monzo Transactions Google Sheet URL:
   ```
   https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/SPREADSHEET_ID_HERE/edit
   ```

### Installation

## Usage

### Basic Setup and Data Access

Create a file called `basic_setup.py`:

```python
from monzo_py import MonzoTransactions

# Initialize with your Google Sheets spreadsheet ID
monzo = MonzoTransactions(spreadsheet_id="your_spreadsheet_id_here")

# Fetch transaction data from Google Sheets
data = monzo.data
print(f"Successfully loaded {len(data)} transactions")

# Preview your data structure
for i, row in enumerate(data[:3]):  # First 3 rows
    print(f"Row {i}: {row}")
```

Run with:
```bash
$ python basic_setup.py
Successfully loaded 5627 transactions
Row 0: ['Transaction ID', 'Date', 'Time', 'Type', 'Name', 'Emoji', 'Category', 'Amount', 'Currency', 'Local amount', 'Local currency', 'Notes and #tags', 'Address', 'Receipt', 'Description', 'Category split']
Row 1: ['tx_00009R5jgIR0O6ricjZJwn', '30/11/2017', '19:24:39', 'prepaid-bridge', '', '', 'General', '37.72', 'GBP', '37.72', 'GBP', 'Prepaid to current transfer', '', '', 'Prepaid to current transfer', '']
Row 2: ['tx_00009R5tJnb9M6SSasNGu9', '30/11/2017', '21:12:38', 'Card payment', 'The Three Crowns', 'üç∫', 'Entertainment', '-11.20', 'GBP', '-11.20', 'GBP', '', '175 Stoke Newington High Street', '', 'THE THREE CROWNS       LONDON  N16   GBR', '']
```

### Transaction Analysis with DuckDB

Create a file called `transaction_analysis.py`:

```python
from monzo_py import MonzoTransactions

# Initialize with your Google Sheets spreadsheet ID
monzo = MonzoTransactions(spreadsheet_id="your_spreadsheet_id_here")

# Create an in-memory DuckDB database
db_conn = monzo.duck_db()

# Basic transaction overview
total_transactions = db_conn.execute("SELECT COUNT(*) FROM transactions").fetchone()[0]
print(f"Total transactions: {total_transactions}")
print()

# Spending by category
print("Spending by category:")
spending_by_category = db_conn.execute("""
    SELECT
        category,
        COUNT(*) as transaction_count,
        ROUND(SUM(amount), 2) as total_spent,
        ROUND(AVG(amount), 2) as avg_amount
    FROM transactions
    WHERE amount IS NOT NULL
        AND amount < 0  -- Only spending (negative amounts)
    GROUP BY category
    ORDER BY total_spent ASC  -- Most spending first (most negative)
""").fetchall()

for category, count, total, avg in spending_by_category:
    print(f"{category}: {count} transactions, ¬£{abs(total):.2f} total, ¬£{abs(avg):.2f} avg")

print()

# Monthly spending trends
print("Monthly spending trends:")
monthly_spending = db_conn.execute("""
    SELECT
        strftime('%Y-%m', date) as month,
        ROUND(SUM(amount), 2) as net_spending
    FROM transactions

    GROUP BY strftime('%Y-%m', date)
    ORDER BY month DESC
    LIMIT 12
""").fetchall()

for month, net_spending in monthly_spending:
    print(f"{month}: ¬£{abs(net_spending):.2f} net spending")

print()

# Large transactions analysis
print("Largest transactions:")
large_transactions = db_conn.execute("""
    SELECT date, name, description, amount
    FROM transactions
    WHERE amount IS NOT NULL
        AND (amount > 100 OR amount < -100)

for date, name, description, amount in large_transactions:
    print(f"{date} | {name} | {description} | ¬£{amount:.2f}")

# Don't forget to close the connection

The script will generate three interactive visualizations:
- **Monthly trends**: Line chart comparing income vs spending over time
- **Category breakdown**: Pie chart showing spending distribution across categories
- **Spending heatmap**: Visual representation of when you spend money throughout the week

## Data Structure

The library maps your Google Sheets columns to a structured database with the following schema:

| Column | Field Name | Description |
|--------|------------|-------------|
| A | `transaction_id` | Unique transaction identifier |
| B | `date` | Transaction date |
| C | `time` | Transaction time |
| D | `type` | Transaction type (Payment/Transfer) |
| E | `name` | Merchant or payee name |
| F | `emoji` | Transaction emoji |
| G | `category` | Spending category |
| H | `amount` | Transaction amount |
| I | `currency` | Transaction currency |
| J | `local_amount` | Local amount (if different currency) |
| K | `local_currency` | Local currency |
| L | `notes_and_tags` | Notes and hashtags |
| M | `address` | Merchant address |
| N | `receipt` | Receipt information |
| O | `description` | Transaction description |
| P | `category_split` | Category split identifier |

> [!TIP]
> Headers in your spreadsheet are automatically ignored - data is mapped by column position (A through P).
